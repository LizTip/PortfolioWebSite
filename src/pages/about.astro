        <p class="mb-4">
          I'm Elizabeth Tipper, currently studying BSc (Hons) Computer Science with Cyber Security at the University of Brighton. I'm building a career in cyber security, combining technical coursework, practical coding projects, and real-world experience from my background in financial operations.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
          Over the past two years, I've worked on projects in network security, mobile app development, and object-oriented programming. I've also developed strong skills in ethical hacking, virtualisation, scripting, and secure software design.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
          Prior to my degree, I spent over a decade in finance as a PA and Billing Clerk, gaining a detail-oriented, client-facing work ethicâ€”skills I now apply in tech.
